# Front End Angular Challenge

We'd like you to implement a version of Tic-Tac-Toe.  The rules can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

## Details

* We would like you to build your solution using AngularJS.  We have provided you with a boilerplate project (based on NG6-Starter - https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter).

* The project uses Angular 1.5 and you should write your code using Angular components.  The boilerplate includes some components to get you started.

* Don't worry too much about presentation, we aren't looking for something pixel-perfect.  We'd rather you concentrated on the code.

* We are not looking for responsive layouts or cross-browser compatibility.  We will be running your code in Chrome.

* Please make use of ES6 language features where possible.  We are looking for modern coding practices.

* Please use comments where you feel they are necessary and try to make your code as readable as possible.

* We'd like you to spend 4-6 hours on your solution and we will be using it as a talking point during your face-to-face interview.

* Please can you provide a quick overview of the code when you submit your test, giving us an indication of how far you progressed.

## installation

* Fork this repo.

* Create a local clone.

* In your locally cloned folder, run `npm install` to install dependancies.

* Run `npm start` - this runs a dev server, serving your files at http://localhost:3000

* For a full list of build tasks and an automated procedure for creating new Angular components, please review the NG6-Starter documentation - https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter.

* Once completed, please upload to a Github account and send us the link so we can take a look.

Thanks and good luck.
